# Deploying-a-Lambda-Function
I created an AWS Lambda function and configured an event notification for Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).


<h2>Description</h2>
I created an AWS Lambda function that resizes an uploaded image to create a thumbnail. I configured an event notification in Amazon S3 to trigger the Lambda function whenever an image is uploaded. The function processes the original image, resizes it into a thumbnail, and saves it in a target S3 bucket. Finally, I monitored the Lambda function's performance and logged events using Amazon CloudWatch.<br />

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b> HTML: </b> For creating the basic webpage, including hyperlinks, an HTML entity, and a favicon.
- <b> Bash: </b> For running commands in the AWS Cloud9 terminal (e.g., verifying the Apache2 service, moving files).
- <b> AWS Cloud9 IDE: </b> Integrated development environment where the web server was configured and the webpage was created.
- <b> Amazon EC2: </b>  The virtual server (Ubuntu Linux instance) hosting the Apache2 web server.
- <b> Apache2: </b> The web server that served the webpage.
- <b> Linux Commands (via Bash): </b>  Used for troubleshooting and configuring the server, moving files, and running system commands (e.g., systemctl to check Apache2 status).

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

 <b>Cloud Platform:
AWS (Amazon Web Services): This project was conducted entirely in AWS, utilizing several of its services.
</b> 
<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

The following diagram depicts the basic architecture of the lab environment. The resources depicted in the diagram already exist in your Amazon Web Services (AWS) account when you start the lab.

<i>Figure 1: The diagram illustrates a website developer working in an AWS Cloud environment using an AWS Cloud9 IDE hosted on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance. The instance is set up in a security-controlled public subnet of a virtual private cloud (VPC) and is accessible over the internet. The hosted website is available to consumers through the Apache HTTP Server running on the EC2 instance. For more information, refer to the following detailed diagram overview.</i>

<br />


My first step was connecting to AWS Cloud 9 IDE. After connecting to the Cloud 9 environment I verified that the web server was running by using the following command: <b> sudo systemctl status apache2</b>.

<br />

I wanted to observe the web server document root directory and contents. To discover the default web server DocumentRoot location, I ran the following command: <b> cat /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf</b>. In the web serverâ€™s configuration file, webpages are served to users from the default directory /var/www/html. To list the contents of the default directory,  you can run the following command: <b> ls /var/www/html</b>.

<br />

To retrieve the IPv4 public IP address of the instance AWS Cloud9 is running on, run this command: <b> curl 169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4</b>. You will use this public IP address to load the webpage.

<br />

The webpage would not load for me.

<br />

I began troubleshooting. I wanted to check for connectivity issues so I started checking for any network issues. I looked at the security group rules. The security group acts as a virtual firewall. When I checked the inbound rules I noticed there was no rule to allow traffic from the internet.
![Instance Inbound Rules](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b47ef338-c2e4-45ba-91b6-75e97eb0e990)


<br />

I added an inbound rule to allow all traffic from any IP address.

<br />

I reloaded the webpage after my configuration changes. It was successful this time.

<br />

I moved the existing index.html file to a backup location. To do this: Return to the AWS Cloud9 Bash terminal, and run the following command: <b> sudo mv /var/www/html/index.html /var/tmp/</b>.
I tried to reload the webpage after making these changes, but the page would not load.

<i>Figure 2: This message is displayed because there are currently no files in the DocumentRoot location.</i>


<br />

I configured the AWS Cloud9 IDE environment window to show the web server document root. To do so, in the AWS Cloud9 Bash terminal, run the following commands: <b> ln -s /var/www/ /home/ubuntu/environment/www
sudo chown -R ubuntu /var/www/</b>.  The first command created a symlink to the /var/www directory in your environment directory. The second command changed ownership of the files in the /var/www directory so the ubuntu user (which is you) can edit the files in this www directory. If you want, you can verify the user by running whoami.

<br />

I began creating a <span zeum4c20="PR_1_0" data-ddnwab="PR_1_0" aria-invalid="grammar" class="Lm ng">webpage</span> for "Anycompany Bicycle parts". I was so proud of myself for getting the header to display that I deviated from the project. Here is a temporary message where I'm asking for a job.
![Successful webpage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/576b59f4-0434-4933-a737-fcd9fbcef71a)


Now it's time to get back on track. I added some heading and paragraph elements. I was able to add hyperlinks to jump to different sections in my webpage. Additionally, I was able to open links in a different <span zeum4c20="PR_2_0" data-ddnwab="PR_2_0" aria-invalid="spelling" class="LI ng">browswer</span> from my webpage. I added a target attribute and gave it the value of "_blank." I added an HTML entity as well. I figured out how to include the copyright symbol. It can be achieved by typing: <b><p>&copy; </b>. Below you will see a snippet of my HTML code.

<br />

Finally I completed my webpage. It turned out better than I expected.
